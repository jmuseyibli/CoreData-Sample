#  CoreData-Sample

## Overview:
This is a sample project that uses a simplified model of mobile bank application's payments screen. For the sake of simplicity, the app is connected to a sample server which occassionally returns error messages on purpose. In such error cases, CoreData is used as a fallback mechanism to provide app user with a smoother interface.
